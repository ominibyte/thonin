As mdns is used for the local network, this means that discoveries can be made from
End Devices -> Edge Device
Edge Device -> Fog Device (Possibly)
Communicating with other levels require other protocols like CoAP. This means that Each App needs to have a config
file where the IP address would be configured, using a custom DSL which we can make compatible with a subset of TOSCA


Any level within the stack can be missing like the implementation could be from End Device directly to the Cloud or
it could just be an application for the Edge device or End device so the config file would need to specify these details
